# Public Access Solution for Winnex Pro Audit

## The Problem
Your Replit project is private, so external auditors get redirected to login/registration page.

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Deploy via Replit
1. **Look for "Deploy" button** in your Replit toolbar
2. **Click Deploy** to create public `.replit.app` URL
3. **Share that URL** - it will be publicly accessible

### Solution 2: Make Project Public in Replit
Since the privacy settings are hard to find, try these locations:
- **Project name dropdown** (top left)
- **Three dots menu** (top right)  
- **Settings gear icon** (look for Privacy/Visibility)

### Solution 3: Export Platform for External Hosting

I can help you export your Winnex Pro platform to host elsewhere:
