# Simple Solution for External Audit Access

## Problem: External auditor cannot access your Winnex Pro platform

## Solution Options (Try in this order):

### Option 1: Current Development URL
Your platform is running at your Replit development URL right now.
- Look at your webview/preview window
- Copy that exact URL 
- Send it to your auditor
- Many Replit dev URLs are already publicly accessible

### Option 2: Create Public Replit Account Access
If Option 1 doesn't work:
1. Tell your auditor to create a FREE Replit account at replit.com
2. Once they have an account, share your project with them
3. They can then run and access your platform

### Option 3: Export and Host Elsewhere
If Replit access is the issue:
1. Download your project files
2. Upload to a service like Netlify, Vercel, or Heroku
3. These provide public URLs immediately

### Option 4: Screen Recording Demo
If all else fails:
1. Record a screen video of your platform working
2. Show all features: betting, crypto payments, monitoring
3. Share video with auditor as proof of functionality
