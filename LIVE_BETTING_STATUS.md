## API Integration Status

### The Odds API Integration
- Authentication format implemented
- API endpoints configured for:
  - Live sports data
  - Real-time odds
  - Arbitrage detection
  - Multiple bookmaker coverage
- **Issue**: API key validation failed with "INVALID_KEY" error

### Required for Live Data
To enable real live betting odds, we need:

1. **Valid Odds API Key**: The provided key format appears to be for a different service
   - Current key: `dex_22e37bcb611beb0210ab79d1b9441973`
   - Expected format: Standard API key from https://the-odds-api.com

2. **Alternative Approach**: 
   - Use a different sports data provider

   - Get proper credentials for The Odds API
